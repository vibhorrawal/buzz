# Bus Reservation System aka BUZZ
This is a project for 3rd semester that uses sqlite3 for managing DataBase. The front-end was not developed by me. To run it you need Flask. You can install the requirements by running <br>
`sudo apt install flask` <br> `pip3 install flask-session` <br>
<br>
### To run the project, run the command - 
<br>
```flask run``` <br>
or <br>
```python3 app.py```
<br>
Database is stored in [database.db](database.db). You can modify/view it by using any DB browser. 
> Default login-id/pass is `1234`
